Welcome to our new podcast. We are happy to announce the first of our 30 minute monthly series titled The Library is Open! This first session features an interview with Joann Ransom, who was integral in the initial funding and development of Koha, the first web based and open source integrated library system. Hear about the challenges she faced when spearheading this monumental task and learn what she has been up to since, including her world tour of Koha libraries! You can see our pretty faces on the video version of this conversation on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/bywatersolutions) channel, listen right here, subscribe to our podcast, or all of the above. Enjoy!
