We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Todayâ€™s session features an interview with Myka Kennedy Stephens, Seminary Librarian and Assistant Professor at the [Lancaster Theological Seminary](https://lancasterseminary.edu/) in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Myka has been working in libraries for more than a decade and has a strong background in library leadership and open source information systems.

Over the last 3 years at Lancaster Theological Seminary Library, Myka has developed and implemented several innovative library services including embedded library services, seminary archives, library systems administration, and open source initiatives. In this podcast we will be discussing moving to an Open Source ILS, how the move opened the door to other Open Source options, and the benefits her library has seen.
