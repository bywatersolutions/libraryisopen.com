We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Todayâ€™s session features question and answer with Kyle Hall, Lead Developer or otherwise known as Lord of the Code for ByWater Solutions. Join us as we discuss the 17.05 release for Koha Open Source ILS where Kyle volunteered as Release Manager. Listen to what is on the horizon and what we will see in [Koha 17.05](https://koha-community.org/).

Kyle received his M.S. in Information Technology from Edinboro University of PA. He has been fulfilling the IT needs of librarians for over a decade at the Crawford County Federated Library System, where his department secured sponsorship for the integration of Zebra into Koha. His work not only included enhancing Koha itself, but also authorship of the [Koha Offline Circulation](http://millruntech.com/koha/koha-offline-circulation) tool and the maintenance of the Koha Virtual Appliance. He is also the author of [Libki](http://libki.org/), an Open Source library kiosk management system.
