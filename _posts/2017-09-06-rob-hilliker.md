We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Robert Hilliker from [the Hotchkiss School](https://www.hotchkiss.org/) in Lakeville, Connecticut. Rob is the Director of the Edsel Ford Memorial Library. He joined the School in 2013 and set the stage by rolling out the new ILS for students by switching to Koha.

The Edsel Ford Memorial Library provides students with a wealth of research tools — and an ideal place for both individual and group study. Beyond the library’s collection of books and multimedia, students can access a wide range of online databases for research. Each academic department has a designated librarian to help students make the most of the library’s resources, and a knowledgeable staff is available during library hours to provide assistance.
