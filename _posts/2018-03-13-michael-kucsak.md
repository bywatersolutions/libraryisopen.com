We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Michael Kucsak, Assistant Dean and Chief of Staff at Virginia Tech University Libraries. In this session Michael discuses why the freedom, flexibility and support system offered by ByWater and Koha was the best choice for the University Libraries. He also talks about managing change, setting the stage for a migration, successful communication and other aspects that prepared them for a migration from a propriety ILS to open source.
