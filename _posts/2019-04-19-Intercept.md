## About Intercept

Intercept is made for libraries by libraries, but in the end, it’s all about the customer.
Libraries are evolving! No longer are they simply a place where books are stored – now they’re increasingly a place where learning, in its many forms, takes place. In fact, while some libraries have experienced a decrease in visitors and circulation, nationwide event attendance is up 30% over the past ten years. Read a complete breakdown on: [Why Intercept?](https://www.libraryintercept.com/why/).
