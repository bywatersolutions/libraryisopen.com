<p>We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Michael Kucsak, Assistant Dean and Chief of Staff at Virginia Tech University Libraries. In this session Michael discuses why the freedom, flexibility and support system offered by ByWater and Koha was the best choice for the University Libraries. He also talks about managing change, setting the stage for a migration, successful communication and other aspects that prepared them for a migration from a propriety ILS to open source.</p>

<h2 id="about-michael-kucsak">About Michael Kucsak</h2>

<p>Michael is a graduate of Florida State University’s School of Library and Information Studies. As a professional librarian, Michael has worked for non-profit library consortia, public, private, k-12 and University libraries. He has been a library technology consultant for several different libraries including the State Library of Florida. While in the private sector, Michael became a Six Sigma Black Belt. Today he combines his skills in process improvement with his experience in library technology as the Assistant Dean and Chief of Staff for Virginia Tech. He continues to present around the country on topics that include process improvement in the library, eBooks, and enhanced discovery services.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Trey Gordner, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.koios.co/">Koios</a>. Trey’s goal is to help libraries fulfill their mission in the digital age. In this session of The Library is Open Podcast, Trey discusses Koios, working with libraries, and what is on the horizon.</p>

<p>Koios began when Trey pitched a library software idea at <a href="http://www.koios.co/blog/2015/7/13/koios-formerly-bibliotech-at-columbia-startup-weekend">Startup Weekend Columbia</a> in November 2014. The idea was a browser extension that checked the library for you from Amazon. A great team came together, built a prototype in just 54 hours, and won the competition. This wasn’t Trey’s first run-in with libraries: he’d been working in and out of them for 5 years, and had just finished consulting with Richland Library on attracting young professionals and technologists. Read more about <a href="https://www.koios.co/our-history/">Koios</a> and how they help libraries.</p>

<h2 id="about-koios">About Koios</h2>

<p>Koios makes free library resources visible in Google search results. They combine a proprietary technology platform (http://www.readlibre.com) with expertise in search engine marketing and search engine optimization, so that libraries appear side-by-side with Amazon. This increases the use of public resources, engenders support for public libraries, and lowers the barrier to lifelong learning.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Robert Hilliker from <a href="https://www.hotchkiss.org/">the Hotchkiss School</a> in Lakeville, Connecticut. Rob is the Director of the Edsel Ford Memorial Library. He joined the School in 2013 and set the stage by rolling out the new ILS for students by switching to Koha.</p>

<p>The Edsel Ford Memorial Library provides students with a wealth of research tools — and an ideal place for both individual and group study. Beyond the library’s collection of books and multimedia, students can access a wide range of online databases for research. Each academic department has a designated librarian to help students make the most of the library’s resources, and a knowledgeable staff is available during library hours to provide assistance.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Robert Hilliker from <a href="https://www.hotchkiss.org/">the Hotchkiss School</a> in Lakeville, Connecticut. Rob is the Director of the Edsel Ford Memorial Library. He joined the School in 2013 and set the stage by rolling out the new ILS for students by switching to Koha.</p>

<p>The Edsel Ford Memorial Library provides students with a wealth of research tools — and an ideal place for both individual and group study. Beyond the library’s collection of books and multimedia, students can access a wide range of online databases for research. Each academic department has a designated librarian to help students make the most of the library’s resources, and a knowledgeable staff is available during library hours to provide assistance.</p>

<p>In this week’s podcast are guests Lori Ayre, Library Technology Consultant at Galecia Group, and Jessamyn West, Librarian and Community Technologist.  Lori works with libraries to optimize their operations and find ways to leverage state-of-the-art technologies to reduce operating expenses without reducing service quality to library patrons.
