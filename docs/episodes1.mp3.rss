<p>We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Sarah Sawicki, Planning &amp; Projects Director and Phillip Higgins, Marketing and Digital Strategy Director at the Richland Library in South Carolina. They are joined by Sally Shaughnessy, Director, Project Management at Aten Design Group in Denver, Colorado. In this podcast we discuss <a href="https://www.libraryintercept.com/">Intercept</a>, an open source event, room, equipment management and customer tracking system.</p>

<h2 id="about-intercept">About Intercept</h2>

<p>Intercept is made for libraries by libraries, but in the end, it’s all about the customer.
Libraries are evolving! No longer are they simply a place where books are stored – now they’re increasingly a place where learning, in its many forms, takes place. In fact, while some libraries have experienced a decrease in visitors and circulation, nationwide event attendance is up 30% over the past ten years. Read a complete breakdown on: <a href="https://www.libraryintercept.com/why/">Why Intercept?</a>.</p>

Now serving as Planning and Projects Director, she guides cross-functional teams through human-centered design to plan and execute new and improved products, services and spaces. She advises other staff serving as project managers on strategic initiatives and ensures the use of data to make informed decisions. Outside of the library, she taps her way through life using her project management superpowers to raise teenaged twin girls, a tween boy, and a pre-teen <a href="http://www.oktoberfestcolumbia.com/">Oktoberfest Columbia</a>.</p>

<p>Phillip regularly speaks at events around the country, talking about the work that Richland Library does for the community and the strategies and tactics that his team employs to support that work. He is “uber happy” (his words) to share what he’s learned with others and to help everyone reimagine what it means to be a 21st century library.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Trey Gordner, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.koios.co/">Koios</a>. Trey’s goal is to help libraries fulfill their mission in the digital age. In this session of The Library is Open Podcast, Trey discusses Koios, working with libraries, and what is on the horizon.</p>

<p>Koios began when Trey pitched a library software idea at <a href="http://www.koios.co/blog/2015/7/13/koios-formerly-bibliotech-at-columbia-startup-weekend">Startup Weekend Columbia</a> in November 2014. The idea was a browser extension that checked the library for you from Amazon. A great team came together, built a prototype in just 54 hours, and won the competition. This wasn’t Trey’s first run-in with libraries: he’d been working in and out of them for 5 years, and had just finished consulting with Richland Library on attracting young professionals and technologists. Read more about <a href="https://www.koios.co/our-history/">Koios</a> and how they help libraries.</p>

<h2 id="about-koios">About Koios</h2>

<p>Koios makes free library resources visible in Google search results. They combine a proprietary technology platform (http://www.readlibre.com) with expertise in search engine marketing and search engine optimization, so that libraries appear side-by-side with Amazon. This increases the use of public resources, engenders support for public libraries, and lowers the barrier to lifelong learning.</p>
