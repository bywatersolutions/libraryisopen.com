&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Trey Gordner, Founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koios.co/&quot;&gt;Koios&lt;/a&gt;. Trey’s goal is to help libraries fulfill their mission in the digital age. In this session of The Library is Open Podcast, Trey discusses Koios, working with libraries, and what is on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koios began when Trey pitched a library software idea at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.koios.co/blog/2015/7/13/koios-formerly-bibliotech-at-columbia-startup-weekend&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend Columbia&lt;/a&gt; in November 2014. The idea was a browser extension that checked the library for you from Amazon. A great team came together, built a prototype in just 54 hours, and won the competition. This wasn’t Trey’s first run-in with libraries: he’d been working in and out of them for 5 years, and had just finished consulting with Richland Library on attracting young professionals and technologists. Read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koios.co/our-history/&quot;&gt;Koios&lt;/a&gt; and how they help libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-koios&quot;&gt;About Koios&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koios makes free library resources visible in Google search results. They combine a proprietary technology platform (http://www.readlibre.com) with expertise in search engine marketing and search engine optimization, so that libraries appear side-by-side with Amazon. This increases the use of public resources, engenders support for public libraries, and lowers the barrier to lifelong learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-more&quot;&gt;Learn More&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Edsel Ford Memorial Library provides students with a wealth of research tools — and an ideal place for both individual and group study. Beyond the library’s collection of books and multimedia, students can access a wide range of online databases for research. Each academic department has a designated librarian to help students make the most of the library’s resources, and a knowledgeable staff is available during library hours to provide assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week’s podcast are guests Lori Ayre, Library Technology Consultant at Galecia Group, and Jessamyn West, Librarian and Community Technologist.  Lori works with libraries to optimize their operations and find ways to leverage state-of-the-art technologies to reduce operating expenses without reducing service quality to library patrons. Jessamyn can teach anyone to use a computer and enjoys using free and open source tools to help libraries better serve their patrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us as we talk about Bookpoints, software that helps public libraries manage their summer reading programs. Bookpoints allows library staff to connect more people with summer reading through gamification and an engaging interface. This program helps librarians assess and demonstrate the their programs’ impact using built-in evaluation tools. Bookpoints also efficiently manage and report on their summer program.&lt;/p&gt;
