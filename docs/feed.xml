&lt;p&gt;Intercept is made for libraries by libraries, but in the end, it’s all about the customer.
Libraries are evolving! No longer are they simply a place where books are stored – now they’re increasingly a place where learning, in its many forms, takes place. In fact, while some libraries have experienced a decrease in visitors and circulation, nationwide event attendance is up 30% over the past ten years. Read a complete breakdown on: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libraryintercept.com/why/&quot;&gt;Why Intercept?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Trey Gordner, Founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koios.co/&quot;&gt;Koios&lt;/a&gt;. Trey’s goal is to help libraries fulfill their mission in the digital age. In this session of The Library is Open Podcast, Trey discusses Koios, working with libraries, and what is on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koios began when Trey pitched a library software idea at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.koios.co/blog/2015/7/13/koios-formerly-bibliotech-at-columbia-startup-weekend&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend Columbia&lt;/a&gt; in November 2014. The idea was a browser extension that checked the library for you from Amazon. A great team came together, built a prototype in just 54 hours, and won the competition. This wasn’t Trey’s first run-in with libraries: he’d been working in and out of them for 5 years, and had just finished consulting with Richland Library on attracting young professionals and technologists. Read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koios.co/our-history/&quot;&gt;Koios&lt;/a&gt; and how they help libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-koios&quot;&gt;About Koios&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koios makes free library resources visible in Google search results. They combine a proprietary technology platform (http://www.readlibre.com) with expertise in search engine marketing and search engine optimization, so that libraries appear side-by-side with Amazon. This increases the use of public resources, engenders support for public libraries, and lowers the barrier to lifelong learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-more&quot;&gt;Learn More&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce our newest session for The Library is Open Podcast! Today’s session features an interview with Robert Hilliker from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotchkiss.org/&quot;&gt;the Hotchkiss School&lt;/a&gt; in Lakeville, Connecticut. Rob is the Director of the Edsel Ford Memorial Library. He joined the School in 2013 and set the stage by rolling out the new ILS for students by switching to Koha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Edsel Ford Memorial Library provides students with a wealth of research tools — and an ideal place for both individual and group study. Beyond the library’s collection of books and multimedia, students can access a wide range of online databases for research. Each academic department has a designated librarian to help students make the most of the library’s resources, and a knowledgeable staff is available during library hours to provide assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
